//? Binary heap rule: parent node always larger => max heap
//* left to right insertion => preserve order, so the tree always balanced

//! Binary heap implementation is in priority queue

//? pros and cons:
//!pros:
//* better than O(n)
//* there is priority
//* flexible size
//* fast insert => because of priority, to be placed on top

//! cons:
//* slow lookup (O(n))
